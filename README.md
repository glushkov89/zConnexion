# zConnexion
Adds support for 3DConnexion devices to zBrush.
Not relevant "as-is" anymore, as there is already native support for space mouse in zBrush.

Might be interesting for the following:
1. Interprocess communication for zScript (see DLL)
2. Proper rotation calculation formulas (see zScript)
3. Old 3DConnexion hardware support.
